Small team, big project: In just two years we developed Datawrapper into a popular, internationally used visualization tool. Datawrapper enables everyone to create basic, but correct charts which can be embedded on any website. The work in this project is ongoing, it is currently our most important project at Journalism++ Cologne, in close collaboration with Journalism++ Paris/Berlin.
