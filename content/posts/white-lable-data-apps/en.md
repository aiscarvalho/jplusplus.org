Newsrooms should be able to work with code. Should be able to develop small, smart apps when needed. Not in two years, but in two weeks or - if need be - two days. As a team we are open to work with organizations interested in exploring the options that are available. 

Journalism ++ as a whole specializes in developing news and data apps with others. We work in the newsroom to avoid loosing the story about an unbalanced work split between journalism and development. 

We work fast, in iterations and on deadline. 

Examples of projects for data apps:

+Investigative data explorations, with multiple angles of data and visualizations.
+Crowdsourcing data with users, to achieve a clearer picture.
+Data-driven decision support for the general public, using calculators and interactive features to enable a clearer view on relevant decisions in life. 

We believe that in a lot of areas the public is underserved with relevant, trustable support apps, that are driven by journalistic values (as opposed to purely marketing-driven offerings). 

If you think, we can help, ping us. We join such projects on all levels, from basic advice and research to fully managed development, which usually starts on a blank page of paper.
